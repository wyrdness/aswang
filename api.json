      "full": "The aswang is one of the most feared creatures in Philippine folklore, a shapeshifting being that lives as a human during the day but becomes a monstrous predator at night. Aswang exist in multiple forms across different Philippine regions: blood-suckers, viscera suckers, weredogs, witches, and ghouls. They possess abilities including shapeshifting into dogs, pigs, or birds, sound reversal (appearing far when close), and in some variants, the ability to detach their upper torso to fly. Aswang particularly target pregnant women and their unborn children, feeding through a long, hollow, proboscis-like tongue. Detection methods include eyes that reflect inverted images, aversion to garlic and salt, and coconut oil revealing their identity. The aswang remains a source of genuine fear in rural Philippine communities and represents deep-rooted cultural beliefs about evil, protection, and the supernatural."
