## Overview

The aswang is one of the most feared creatures in Philippine folklore, a shapeshifting being that lives as a human during the day but becomes a monstrous predator at night.

Aswang exist in multiple forms across different Philippine regions: **blood-suckers**, **viscera suckers**, **weredogs**, **witches**, and **ghouls**. They possess abilities including shapeshifting into dogs, pigs, or birds, **sound reversal** (appearing far when close), and in some variants, the ability to **detach their upper torso** to fly.

Aswang particularly target pregnant women and their unborn children, feeding through a long, hollow, **proboscis-like tongue**. The aswang remains a source of genuine fear in rural Philippine communities and represents deep-rooted cultural beliefs.

> ⚠️ **CULTURAL SENSITIVITY**: Aswang beliefs are part of living Filipino folk tradition. These are not merely entertainment but reflect genuine cultural fears and protective practices.
